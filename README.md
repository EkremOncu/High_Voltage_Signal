This project is my university graduation project. 

I worked with High Voltage Signal.

The signals obtained from the high voltage experiment performed in a 5 cm diameter sphere-sphere electrode system with 1 cm opening were recorded as a file with a csv extension for each voltage type with the help of an oscilloscope.

There are 7 signals in total as AC signal, Positive DC, Negative DC, 2 AC Positive 6 kV_DC and 2 AC Negative6 kV_DC.

Each csv file contains approximately 1,048,576 lines of Current data and Voltage data.

I studied those signal with using Pyton.

In this project, real-time high voltage signals were plotted by calculating their characteristic sizes, and then GUI was designed using the Tkinter library, enabling more efficient analysis of the data and easy access to the data.
